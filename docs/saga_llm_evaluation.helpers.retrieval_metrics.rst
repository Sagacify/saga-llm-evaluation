Retrieval Metrics
=================

Retrieval metrics are essential for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of information retrieval systems. 
These metrics help in assessing how well a system retrieves relevant information in response to a query, either by comparing the retrieved results to a ground truth or by measuring the relevance of the retrieved chunks to the query.

In the context of large language models (LLMs), retrieval metrics play a crucial role in determining the model's ability to fetch and present relevant information from a vast corpus of data. 
These metrics ensure that the model not only generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses but also retrieves information that is accurate and pertinent to the user's query.
